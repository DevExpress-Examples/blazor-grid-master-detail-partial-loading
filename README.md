# Grid for Blazor - Master-Detail with partial loading

The DevExpress Blazor Grid component allows you to create hierarchical layouts of any complexity and depth. 

This example uses a nested component to visualize a master-detail relationship between two data tables. It also shows how to integrate a Loading Panel into the detail area. The panel appears while the nested component retrieves records from a database and renders them.

Follow the steps below to set up a master-detail relationship:

1. Add a master grid to your application. Specify the grid's data source and columns. In this example, the **Index.razor** file implements the master grid.
2. Add a [DetailRowTemplate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.DetailRowTemplate) to the grid's markup to create a detail view.
3. Create a separate component that implements a detail view (**DetailContent.razor**). This view may contain any custom content. In this example, another grid displays detail information. The **GetItemsByDateAsync** method imitates a time-consuming operation that retrieves data.
4. Place a Loading Panel to the detail view markup. The following snippet keeps the Loading Panel visible until the detail control obtains its data:

    ```Razor
    <DxLoadingPanel Visible=@(Records == null) />
    ```
    
5. Add the detail view to the **DetailRowTemplate**. Bind this view to a detail data source (use the template's context object as a filter criteria).
